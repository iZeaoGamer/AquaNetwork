## VirtualPE Development updates:

- Start work on SkyFactions (Our first mixed gamemode), between Factions and SkyBlock.
- Added a very unique way of raiding: Cores. (Info at #ðŸ‘€ãƒ»sneakpeaks.)

**What are Cores?**
- Cores, are essentially a way of raiding. If you have a core, then you can't be raided. If your core get's destroyed, raiding is possible. Try to protect the core as much as possible, fight enemies, and get them away from the core.


**How does a core work?**
To raid an Island you first need to destroy the core of an Island. This core can be upgraded with "Essences" and gets more and more health per Upgrade. After the core of an island is being destroyed the attackers are able to completely raid the base and loot them. The defenders of the base can defend their base too, with traps or other Features. You can also save money in a Core.
If you click on the core of your faction you open a GUI where you can do different things, just as giving it Essences and saving money.

- You can no longer kill the core when you're a member of the island. Same also applies to if you're an owner of that island.

- Fixed being able to leave your own island using /is leave.

- Fixed being able to remove yourself from your own island. These issues lead to consequences. 

- Added custom island area (Thanks to @kewl kenny for this!)

- All islands are now 60 blocks away from each other. This is to make raiding possible, and how you do that, is build to another island from your island, and you can try to get in by many varies of ways (TNT, Creeper eggs, breaking, and so much more!)

- Fixed being able to kill the core when you're a member of an owner's island, and if the owner of the island is offline.

- Added check to ensure the killer is the same as one of the list of Members from /is members.

- Upon island creation, an end crystal (Core) will spawn upon your island.

- Fixed going through the void when you first spawn on your island.

- Added more details to a player's health with nametags. Displays the following things:
* Current Health / Max Health.

* Percentage, current health dividing it by max health.

* Hearts. Red Hearts means that's how much out of a percentage your health is at. It goes all the way up to 20 to reduce clogging of hearts, but your health can go up to way more than that. The hearts count via percentage.

- Fixed client crashes with the new HP update.

- Fixed crash when breaking/placing blocks from an island that's not yours.

- Added world border plugin!
