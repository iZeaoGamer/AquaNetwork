## AquaNetwork Development updates:

## This changelog introduces a new and complete Core revamp, along with: Major API changes (API BC), and many changes with the concurrent networking stage.

- Added more details to a player's health with nametags. Displays the following things:
* Current Health / Max Health.

* Percentage, current health dividing it by max health.

* Hearts. Red Hearts means that's how much out of a percentage your health is at. It goes all the way up to 20 to reduce clogging of hearts, but your health can go up to way more than that. The hearts count via percentage.

- Fixed client crashes with the new HP update.

- Finally added social spy to the server!

- Added new API function: getSocialSpyPlayers(). This function will retrieve all online players using socialspy.

- All chat messages will now appear even if the database is down directly to discord.

- You can now talk in /sc, even if the database is offline.

- You can now talk publicly from in-game to discord whilst the database is offline too now. Before, this wouldn't of been a thing.

- #👀・last-seen, #⚕・staff-commands and #🤖・player-commands now appear messages even when the database is offline.

- We've fixed the interaction spam to do with Interacting with vanished items (Staff mode), so you should no longer receive any spam when clicked on once.

- Added new command: /socialspy AKA /ss - Socialspy commands.

- We've completely got rid of the old 1 minute, 1 second stuff for #👀・last-seen, and made a new API for it which should work a lot better. Alongside this, the restart time system has been completely rewritten to make it better.

- This may look the same, but I've just made a few code improvements on the restart system.

## Vanishing

* We've completely rewritten Vanish time system. We've added short signatures, such as 1s for 1 second, 1m for 1 minute.

## Other Changes
* We've  made some changes to #👀・last-seen and other minor features, such as If a minute, second, hour, or day is at 1, it won't display the "s". As that's grammatical incorrect, and shouldn't be used all the time. This is now correct.

- Fixed crash when loading scoreboards.

- We've completely rewritten scoreboards, once again! They now look 1000x better than before.

- Added Vanish Support to the new scoreboard system.

- Fixed issues where the old scoreboard system would interfere with the new scoreboard system (In terms with vanishing).

- We've added a lot of things to nametags! Such as:

* Device
* Ping
* Hearts
* Faction name and faction rank. (Depending on the server you're currently on)
* Player rank

- Added Activity Points. 

## How they work?
- Activity points, is a currency system for the Network, where you can do certain subjective's to receive Activity points. There are a few ways you can get Activity points. The ways are:
* Mining - 0.5 per break. (Per server)
* Placing - 0.25 per place. (Per server)
* Being active on the server. 0.05 per second (Network)
* Killing an enemy - 100 per kill. (Per server)


- We've added a new channel: #👊・punishments. This channel will log all punishments, made to the server automatically. If you: Unban a user, ban a user, mute or unmute a user, it'll now state this in #👊・punishments. Please keep in mind - The reason why we still have #❕・punishment-format and #📝・punishment-logs is because when punishing a user, you still need to provide proof of that punishment. The punishment system can't automatically do that for you, hence why we have to do it manually.

- Added new command: /ban

- Added new command: /mute

- Added new command: /unmute

- Added new command: /unban

- We've fixed many bugs relating to command exploits, and being able to use certain commands whilst muted.

- Fixed Mute messages displaying incorrectly.

- Fixed ban messages displaying incorrectly.

- Fixed mute command from kicking you.

- You can now mute, and ban offline players also.

- Fixed ban messages from displaying incorrectly.

- Fixed mute messages from displaying incorrectly.

- Fixed mute command from kicking you from the server.

- Fixed bans and mutes not saving to MySQL Database.

- We've added a brand new system for Aliases, which has more than one alias option. If you use /alias [player], it'll state: "IP, XUID, Self Signed ID, Device ID, and Client Random ID. "

- You can now alias offline players finally!

- We've implemented a new network methoding stage! How it works:

So currently, this doesn't affect anything, but once more servers get added, you will see a good difference.

## HOW IT WORKS
- We are adding our servers to MySQL. As a good thing about MySQL, is you can actually make a multi-server with it. We have created our very own MYSQL Database for our servers through out the network. Those affected will be/are:

* Total Online Players - When we add more than one server, you can tell the Online Player Count and Max Player Count is higher than previously. No, this isn't fake slots. This is because we managed to link our server slots, and max player slots to the MySQL Database, which displays more players / max players than usual: It displays total amount of players online and the total max players online, if +80. For example, if there was two servers, and they were both 80 max slots,
the database will recognize this, and display 160 max player slots instead of 80, as it's counting the max player slots of both servers. 
* Displaying if the server is online. Returns true if online, returns false if not. 

* Displaying if the server is in maintenance mode. Returns true if online, returns false if not.

* Displays server IP.

* Displays Server port (The port is automatically checked from the server.properties server-port option.)

* Server Alias: Currently, this only includes the server name. We may make this with some use soon.

* ServerName: The server name it displays in.

## NOTE
- When using boolean to return true or false, MySQL has it differently, so they're known as "TinyInt". Essentially, it's a 0 or 1 number (0 for false, 1 for true). It converts a boolean into a tinyint (AKA either 0 or 1)

- We've completely revamped some Network::class API's.
- 
- Network::getServerName() no longer relies on the server's MOTD. It'll return the actual name of the server. This is so we can add our own MOTD.

## CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES WITH THIS UPDATE
- Sometimes the Maintenance mode would be set to true or false, even if it's not whitelisted. This would only occur when you're using the command from another server after that specific server is being whitelisted/unwhitelisted.

- Fixed some commands not working as intended. The fix, was to use ./ instead of /, but this should now be fixed.

- Disable Network Core if server name and ip is invalid.

- Completely cleaned-up a bunch of junk with commands being in the wrong classes and folders.

- Most command's autofill should now be fixed. Issues with this would be things like commands appearing even if you don't have permission to use it.

- Made a new folder: Moderation, which has all the moderation commands for staff.

- We've completely moved all of the moderation commands to essential\command\types\moderation, and moved a few older moderation commands to that folder also.

- Fixed /spectate command from breaking, and didn't output the correct command usages.

- Check if the server is online when transferring a player to a specific server. If it returns true, it'll skip that check. If it returns false, it'll give you an error message.

- Check if the server is whitelisted when transferring a player to a specific server. If it returns true, it'll skip that check. If it returns false, it'll give you an error message.

- Added the new and updated WaterDog support for Transferring servers. It'll use the $player->transfer() method, whether you use waterdog or not, it'll still use the same transfer method. If you're using Waterdog, then the Transfer function will go to waterdog's transferring method. This change is useful so we don't have to change anything majorly when switching to a proxy in the future. 

- Added new command: /transfer - This command will allow you to transfer to any of our servers within the network. 

- Fixed users not being transferred properly, and getting the "Disconnected from server" bug during its restart.

- Cleaned-up useless parmaters for BuildMode Command, and made it work like the other commands.

- Fixed crash when transferring to a server they're banned from.

- Fixed crash when transferring to a server they're not whitelisted on.

- Fixed a crash when transferring to a server that is not online.

- Added API methoding for Bossbars. Using Network::getDiverseBossBar(), and Network::getBossBar() API methods.
* Another way to obtain them is by using DiverseBossBar::get() and BossBar::get().

## What are the difference between DiverseBossBar, and Normal BossBar?

* DiverseBossBar: Sends different data per player.
* BossBar: Sends the same data per player.

- Removed Network::isGamemode() API function because it will now always return true, so the best option is to remove it entirely.
- ## Removed the following API Methods:
* Network::onEnchant()
* Network::isEnchantmentServer()
* Network::isGamemode()
* Network::updateScoreboard()
* UpdateManager::updatePublicScoreboard()
* Network::timeToSeconds()
* Network::isScoreboard()
* Core::isLobby()
* Core::loadInventories()
* Core::addInventory()
* Core::isLimbo()
* Core::getInventories()

- ## Renamed the following API Methods:
* Network::number_format_short() -> Network::shortNumber(), and improved the function.
* Network::calctime() -> Network::getFullTime()
* Network::timeFormat() -> Network::getFullTime()
* Network::timeToSeconds() -> Network::getFullTime()
* Network::isLobby() -> Network::isLobby() - Returns bool instead of string.

- ## Addded the following new API Methods:
* Network::getTotalPlayers() - Totals all of the players online function, combined.
* Network::readURL() - Reads the link from the URL, can be used for file transfer purposes, code sided.

- Network::isInstalledPlugin() now returns Network::getPluginName(). The difference with Network::isInstalledPlugin(),
* is it checks whether the plugin is null (whether it's installed or not).

- Made Network::isLobby() return a string parmeter, rather than returning the server name.

- Added those with Server::getInstance() to be Network::getCurrentServer() for API flexability.

- Made Network::isEventServer() return a string parmeter, rather than returning the server name.

- Fixed Network::getOnlinePlayersWith() returning a Player::class objective from not being found due to a typo.

- Network::isLobby() now returns the Server::isLobby() instance.

- Fixed crash when respawning.

- Fixed an issue, where players couldn't fly whilst in creative mode.

- We've updated our staff mode system.

## HOW IT WORKS?
* Staff mode, is a moderation feature. We've updated it masssively.

* Added an experiemental feature: Replay Mode. How it works:

** You can now record other players and entities, play back the recording, and save a recording. All in just staff mode.

* Because we have too much items in one inventory space, we've decided to now introduce Pages.

* There are 3 items per page. Papers are pages, and you can go through them all in just over a page. Either click Next page

* to go to the next page number, or previous page item to go to the previous page number
- Fixed not being able to open chests after you've destroyed the core.

- Added our very own Cooldown API (Also publicly available too)

- Added the following API Methods:

* Network::isCooldownActive(): Checks if the cooldown for the given player is active. Returns true if active, returns false if not.

* Network::hasCooldownTime(): Checks if the time set is over. Along with this, you can set a timer for the given player.

* Network::canUseItem(): Checks if the item can be used to interact.

* Network::setCooldownTime(): Resets the cooldown timer.

- Fixed not being able to place blocks.

- You now teleport to the server spawn if you fall into the void.

- Changed up how teleportation cooldown works.

- We're now using: Network::getFullTime() for seconds, rather than using its own timer for things like /spawn

- Removed useless imports.
- Added new class: CoreInfo. This class will be the main course of information, provided to the plugin for either future use or something that's already being used.
* CoreInfo can be used for future things (Like VirtualPE update versions, and what the next version will be.

- Saperated all moderation related stuff, and made it a separate listener class.

- Saperated all Networking related stuff, and made it a separate listener class.

- Added Anti Auto Clicker. Instead of it actually kicking, or banning you, it'll just send out a message to all staff members.

- Added new command: /changelog

- All changes will now be directed via /changelog, directly in-game. We may post some updates on discord also.

- The console username now outputs as Auto Detector, in case of any future anti-cheats that provide custom banning system.

- Fixed being frozen whilst you are leaving the server from giving you an error.

- Updated Frozen's ban system.

- Leaving after you were frozen now bans you for 7 days, and not permanently.

- We've finally added our own Updating system.

## HOW IT WORKS?
* When a new version releases, it'll state this when you first join. Essentially like any other auto updaters, except it isn't deemed as an updater.
* It's basically an updater for the /changelog command. Once a new version releases, it'll state all the information you need, and will give you a book.
* Once you either type /changelog or tap the book on the ground, it'll set your state to "Read latest changes", which will then display There is no new updates available upon next join.
* Because we have a new class: CoreInfo, this makes it so we can update the versions ourselves, without dealing with configuration mess, and less customizability as to what I can do.

- Fixed Chest from going in an incorrect direction upon placed whilst in vanish.

- Vanish chests are now trapped chests, instead of normal chests. This fix was made to prevent conflictions.

- Vanish chests now go in the correct direction.

- We've added more items support to Vanish chests.

- You can no longer break normal chests whilst in vanish, to prevent abuse.

- Fixed crash when joining the server if the database is offline.

- Added even more Database offline support for player joins/leave, comparing versions, and more.

- We've introduced a brand new Discord system called "Staff". Well, that's the category name atleast.

## How does this work?
* So we have a new channel on discord called: #💻・console
* In this channel, we have everything, to storing errors (Not an error message, but an error information that occurred),
* Storing player joins/leaves, staff and player commands, broadcast messages, made from the server to discord,
* Server restart time, and basically anything that logs the server.
* This is more useful for us higherups so we can determine what is going on without actually going on the server.

## API Logics with this
* Well, thanks to our Networking::class, we can broadcast a public message, use Server::getInstance() for broadcasted messages, and we can make it so it logs to discord.
* By using Network::broadcastMessage().

- Fixed color coding font issues from discord's side - Upon join/leave.

- Fixed crashes when opening a vanish chest. This was because some items were causing crashing difficulties, either because it's unknown or isn't yet implemented into pocketmine.

- Delay each onEnable() state message.

- Delay each onDisable state message.

## Why did you do this?
* I did this because before, onEnable() and onDisable() state would randomize each message in a random order. We use sleep(1) upon onEnable() and onDisable() inbetween log messages so it can send out in the correct order.
* You could say this is a type of code hack to prevent messages being randomized, when sometimes it wouldn't make a lot of sense.

- Fixed duplicated chat messages, made in #💻・console.

- We've removed the following channels in AquaNetwork discord server:
* #🗣・ingame-chat, #🚔・ingame-staffchat, #⚕・staff-commands, and 🤖・player-commands.

- We've renamed the following channels in AquaNetwork Discord server:

* #👀・last-seen -> #👀・staff-activity

- We've made some improvements to how a user chats, and uses command.
* Because we've removed a ton of channels that weren't needed, I've decided to implement a way to display if the user is using staff chat or not, same goes for commands (In terms with if they're using socialspy or not.)
* That way, it's a lot easier to over see the situation and chats.

- We've renamed the following chat messages sections/titles.

* Last-seen -> Last Active.

- We've also made improvements to #👀・staff-activity. Here are the following things that were improved on:
* Instead of appearing as 0 seconds, it'll now state that they just logged on/off. This is to prevent many confusions. Thanks to @TableFungi#5578 for bringing this to my attention!

- Fixed an issue, where the server would take a few seconds to actually kick all online players from the server.

- Added Death, and respawn messages to Discord logging.

- Added color coded death messages for in-game!

- Added a new function: Network::removeCode().

* This function will delete any color coding material.

## How this works, is:

* If the & symbol is used for color coding, it'll convert that to an § symbol, which will then clean any § symboled message using TextFormat::clean, which basically deletes any sort of coding material with an § symbol.
* We do it this way because it doesn't detect &, so we have to do that ourselves.

- Fixed /burn command from giving you an error if the database is offline.

- Added new Discord embed titles for anything that's not related to Sender sending the broadcast message.

- Fixed a /burn permission bug issue if the user was opped.

- Fixed players being able to use /burn if they don't have permissions.

- Fixed error upon onDisable() with Saving the Server Management side via MySQL.

- ServerManager now saves if the database was online at that given time. This is to prevent errors.

- Fixed crash upon using /changelog.

- Improved #💻・console.

- Completely fixed Color coding from appearing on discord.

- ## Added the following new API Methods:

* Network::removeCode() - Removes the code symbol, including & also.

* Network::getBlockBelow() - Returns the block below your feet, or the highest Y-Value block located at.

* Network::isBlockBelow() - Checks if the block below isn't air.

* Network::sendAlertToStaff() - Sends a alerted message to all staff members available, meaning if they're online.


- ## Removed the following Player::class methods:
* Player::hasCustomJoin()

* Player::setCustomJoin()

* Player::hasFireworks()

* Player::setFireworks()

* Player::setJoinMessage()

* Player::getJoinMessage()

* Player::getTotalWarns()

* Player::setWarns()

* Player::addKitLevelIncrease()

* Player::removeKitLevelIncrease()

* Player::getKitLevelIncrease()

* Player::getCells()

* Player::getCellByID()

* Player::addCell()

* Player::removeCell()

* Player::loadCells()

* Player::getLastCellSignTapTime()

* Player::setLastCellSignTapTime()

* Player::getLastCellSignTapped()

* Player::setLastCellSignTapped() 

- ## Renamed the following Player::class Methods:

* Player::getVote(callable $callback) -> Player::getVote(), which now returns an integer.

- We've done a lot of core backends to ensure the server has no issues. This includes:

* Adding Multi-Process support for Player::class loaded subjectives.

## How does Multi-Process core work?
* So it isn't like how it sounds - It's essentially a way to use Multiple Plugin classes, which basically works, when before, it didn't work.

- We've added a new function: Player::getPluginClass() - Returns a main class file, dependant of which plugin used Player::load().

- Fixed crash when using /unmute 

- Fixed crash when using /unwarn.

- Fixed crash when using /unban

- Fixed crash upon loading into the server.

- Added Respawn and Death messages to discord.

- ## Renamed the following Network::API Methods:

* Network::getStaffMembers() no longer has a parameter of checking the database. It's now restricted via permissions, not rankings.

- Added offline support for the [item] chat messages.

- ## Added the following API Methods:
* Network::getAdmins() - Get's all admins on the server.

* Network::getManagementMembers() - Returns all staff members that are apart of the Management team. (Including admins).

- Fixed ALERT color coding from not working.

- Fixed staff chat messages not being sent to discord.

- We've finally added NPCS to the spawn (/spawn)

- ## Added the following new Player::class methods.
* Player::hasSpawned() - Checks if the user has spawned yet.

* Player::setSpawned() - Sets whether or not they've spawned into the server yet. More preferribly when onJoin() occurrs.

* Player::setRulesRead() - Sets the reading state for the given player. Can be useful for diagnosing whether or not the players have read the rules.
* If they have, it'll set hasPlayedBefore() to true.

- Fixed crash when checking for staff permissions.

- Fixed crash when checking out the rules.

- Added new command: /rules - Checks out the rules for the server, directly in-game!

- Added very good NPC Skins to /spawn.

- Fixed /spawn from teleporting you to an incorrect place.

- We've modified Player::hasPlayedBefore() a bit, to ensure it supports reading rules, and accepting the terms of service.

- Player::hasPlayedBefore() now only returns true if the player has read the rules. It'll also check for if they haven't played before, but most likely this will return false, as you would need to read the rules and accept the TOS to be marked as "Played before".

- We've added custom erroring system to the rules system.

- We've added checks to ensure the player is new, and if they are, the rules will appear, asking you to agree to the rules, but because of our handy API, we can make it so when you use /rules, this option wouldn't be validated as you're currently playing the server at that time, and wouldn't be able to use /rules if you haven't played before.

- Added /rules - This command will allow you to read the rules without the acceptance mark.

- Database should now go offline instantly. It'll check for its playability, to check if the database is still down, or online upon next database refresh.
* Currently, this works for both offline and online gameplay.
* This means there should be less issues with database crashes because the database goes offline before it communicates with the server.
* The reason why we have the database refresh (every 60 seconds), is so it can check if the database is active/inactive or even offline. Because it only deactivates instantly when the database goes offline. This is to prevent crashes to the server because of database issues.

- Fixed crashes when database goes back online, then goes down, it'll crash the server.
* Because of the database update above, databases will deactivate instantly, dependant on whether or not the database is active.

- I've completely modified Player::teleport(), to ensure spawnpoints with center blocks are fixed.
* We've also added a parmeter, where you can check if the position should be re-positioned to 0.5 x and z. If yes, it'll attempt to find X and Z's 0.5 (Center blocks) positioned.

- ## We've added the following Player::class methods:
* Player::positionSpawn() - Re-positions the given coordinates, depending on the coordinates given in the parmeter(s).

* Player::getSpawnLocation() - Returns the given spawn point. The reason why we've added it to Player::class is simply because of backwards compatibility, and to ensure we can use spawn locations in classes that actually matter.

* Player::setSpawnLocation() - Sets the spawn location at the exact coordinates the player is at.

** To put it simply, setSpawnLocation() also repositions the spawn point the player is standing at.

- Fixed spawning on the edge of the block for all locations that use Player::teleport() method.

- Fixed special character issues with /rules, and /changelog.

- Fixed crash when clicking the X button on Custom Form UI's that have the input option.

- Mark the user has permission if the permission node is null.
* This means we can use hasPermission() in all of our commands. We don't have to, but we can now if we want to.

- We've changed Combat tagging, and how it works.
* Changed Combat timer to 15 seconds.

- Use CombatTag's new API methoding to ensure the user is combat tagged before sending them the timeout message.

- Fixed not being able to move after you've read the rules.

- Fixed crash when closing the /rules UI, by clicking Submit. This was because of the rules acceptance, which won't show if you've played before.

- Added a new parmeter to Player::teleport(): $levelSupport.
* If $levelSupport is true, it'll provide true level support, for example, if you're teleporting to another world, then this option would be useful for that.
* If $levelSupport is false, it'll teleport to the coordinates that are in the current world you're in.

- We've added back Instant respawn, but more basic.

- Fixed crash when hitting the ground too hard message attempts to occur.
* This was because we didn't implement this type of message ourselves. My mistake!

- Fixed dying multiple times in a row.
* This issue was because of the respawn timer. This caused issues with the server, so we therefore recoded it.

- Upon death, it'll now automatically teleport you to spawn.

- Upon death, it'll now also activate PlayerRespawnEvent() for further support compatibility.

- Fixed dying in protected areas, if you fell from a high place.
* This was because we weren't checking if the EntityDamageEvent() was cancelled, and didn't add the @priority tag as Monitor.

- You can no longer die if you're in /fly.

- You can no longer die if you're in creative.

- Fixed /rules from appearing as the color symbol at the end of the whole rule book message.

- Added support for in-game rules only in /rules. To view rules on our discord server, you can read them there!

- Added Discord link to /rules.

- Fixed death messages from occurring twice.

- Plugin loading discord message is now in alphabetical order.

- Plugin disabling discord message is now in alphabetical order.

- /idle now broadcasts it into the console channel on discord.

- Fixed /tp from teleporting you to an inaccurate coordinates, or the player's coordinates, but inaccurately.

- Fixed /spectate on [player] from teleporting you to an inaccurate player's coordinates.

- Fixed Online TP, or selecting a player UI to teleport to, from teleporting you to an inaccurate player's coordinates.

- Fixed /tp from not teleporting you to the coordinates.

- Fixed Nametag above player's head.

- Added more Devices display support to the Scoretag/Nametag.

- Fixed being able to execute /spawn more than once, which would lead to it becoming buggy, having more than one timer enabled at once.

- Fixed crash when giving yourself an id that is out of bounds. Now, it'll default it to stone when you exceed the ID packet limit.
  
- Item names now need to be valid, instead of causing you to crash.

- Fixed all client crashes, and player data corruption when using /item incorrectly, such as when you're giving yourself the id: 1000000000000000000, when that's not an id, and that causes to crash because it's out of reach.

- Removed /give, and replaced this with /item.

- Added Kills and Kill Streaks to the scoreboard, which was proprosed by the suggestion: #61.

- Fixed crash upon joining the server.

- Fixed crash when setting a game rules changed packet.

- Added Ding sound when hitting another player using a bow.

- It'll now display information on the given player when hit by an arrow.

- You can no longer hit yourself using a projectile.

- Changed the error message for Hitting yourself using a projectile.

- Fixed crash when using /ban.

- Fixed crash when using /warn.

- Fixed crash when using /mute.

- Fixed crash when using /unban.

- Fixed crash when using /unwarn.

- Fixed crash when using /unmute.

- Added vanilla command autofill system.

- ActivityPoints will no longer continue if you're in AFK or Idle Mode.

- Fixed crash when you sometimes try to join the server.

- Changed some moderation behaviors to ensure the server is at a better moderation status.

- Fixed double spacing in Player tags.

- Added a new Anti-Glitch system to the server.

## How it works?
  
* We have a new system implemented now, that disallows the following:

- Breaking protected blocks

- Placing protected blocks

- Ender Pearling phasing.

- The anti-glitch implementations for Break and placing will now teleport you to prevent going through blocks. That's how our anti-glitch system works.

- Fixed issue when cancelling EntityTP(), it would crash the server.

- Completely revamped our Moderation system completely. Here's what we've changed:

- Removed the following commands in flavour of /moderate:
* /vanish
* /reveal

- Our moderation system now has a built-in disguise system.

- We now have a paid hosting service! Thanks to @Tivercey for buying the server for us!

- We've completely re-designed our scoreboards system.

- Every scoreboard type, will have a different design-color, which makes it unique from everything else.

- Added a new command: /hud.

* This command, will allow you to open the scoreboard editor. In that UI, you can choose which scoreboards you'd like to enable/disable.

## KEEP IN MIND

* You can only enable one scoreboard at a time.

- We're now supporting MySQL Offline databases.

## How it works? 

* So basically, we support most of the features whilst the database goes offline. If it goes offline, all of the data will automatically be set as a SQLite database, until MySQL comes back online.

- We've completely re-designed our Ban, and mute system, to make it mobile friendly.

- We've renamed the discord channel from #sneakpeeks -> #spoilers to prevent spelling confusions.

- Staff can no longer break/place blocks in Regioned areas, unless they have build mode on.
* Now, this had came as an issue for some time now.
* Basically, this means those that were protected using worldguard,
* will now not allow staff or anybody from breaking/placing blocks unless they use /buildmode on.

## NetworkCore V2.0-dev Version
  
- We've completely re-designed our Network Core's namespaces.

- All API related methods will go in \core\utils

- All namespaces are now built with: core\, instead of VMPE\Zeao

- We've replaced GalacticPlayer Class with: CustomPlayer Class.

- Our Player class namespace is now built with: \core\player, as pre-described in api 4.0, which is what will happen in api 4.0.

- Replaced core\Discord\Zeao to core\discord

- Replaced core\Ranks\Zeao to core\ranks

- Replaced core\ to core\bossbar

- Moved all of the commands to core\commands

- Remove core\essential, and make them all in core\commands

- Removed duplicated core\event(s) folders.

- Fixed a recent bug, where if you try to turn off vanish, even if you're not vanished, it'll say "You have been vanished for 5 decades".

- Fixed our anti-glitch system from glitching you inside a block, which allows you to block glitch.

- As of NetworkCore v2.0.0, we've now added "Traits" API.

## What is a trait?
  
* It's a type of class where you can add a use case after the class code, which allows you to use API Methods in the given trait that you've enter, which would work for Network class, as an example.

- We've moved everything non-network related subjects to its own respectful trait.
* In the upcoming future (Hopefully by api 4.0.0), we will be moving everything that doesn't involve around Networking to its own respectful class.

- We've reverted the startup() messages to our old, but better startup system for the Network core.
* Essentially, this means startup() is 10x faster than before. Say good bye to the previous startup() system, and say hello to our fastest system we currently have in place.

- It now only takes a few seconds for the startup() to fully enable everything. Before, it would take from 30 seconds to a minute or two just for it to start up, which is really long for a server.

- We've revamped our discord server entirely. Removed a lot of channels that weren't needed, and made the discord server cleaner.

* Here are the following discord channels that are being removed:
- #😡・staff-reports -> #💼・management
- #👥・staff-list -> #ℹ・staff-info

- Only staff can now join the server when it's full. We may add this for donators in the future. (To be confirmd).
